Atomic operations on potentially uninitialized integers.

## Motivation

Copying types containing uninitialized bytes (e.g., padding), via the standard library's atomic types
is [undefined behavior because the copy goes through integers][undefined-behavior].

This crate provides a way to soundly perform such operations.

## Platform Support

Currently, x86, x86_64, Arm, AArch64, RISC-V, LoongArch, Arm64EC, s390x, MIPS, PowerPC, MSP430, AVR, SPARC, Hexagon, M68k, C-SKY, and Xtensa are supported.
(You can use `cfg_{has,no}_*` macros to write code based on whether or not which size of primitives is available.)

\[1] Arm's atomic RMW operations are not available on Armv6-M (thumbv6m). RISC-V's atomic RMW operations are not available on targets without the A (or G which means IMAFD) or Zalrsc or Zacas extension, such as riscv32i, riscv32imc, etc. M68k's atomic RMW operations requires target-cpu M68020+ (enabled by default on Linux). C-SKY's atomic RMW operations requires target-cpu ck860\* (enabled by default on the hard-float target). Xtensa's atomic RMW operations are not available on esp32s2.<br>
\[2] Requires `cmpxchg16b` target feature (enabled by default on Apple, Windows (except Windows 7), and Fuchsia targets).<br>
\[3] Armv6+ or Linux/Android, except for M-profile architecture such as thumbv6m, thumbv7m, etc.<br>
\[4] Requires `zacas` target feature.<br>
\[5] Requires `quadword-atomics` target feature (enabled by default on powerpc64le).<br>
\[6] Requires `v9` or `leoncasa` target feature (enabled by default on Linux).<br>
\[7] Requires Rust 1.84+.<br>
\[8] Requires Rust 1.91+.<br>
\[9] Requires nightly due to `#![feature(asm_experimental_arch)]`.<br>
\[10] Requires target-cpu M68020+ (enabled by default on Linux).<br>
