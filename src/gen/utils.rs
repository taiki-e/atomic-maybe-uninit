// On AArch64, the base register of memory-related instructions must be 64-bit.
// Passing a 32-bit value to `in(reg)` on AArch64 results in the upper bits
// having an undefined value, but to work correctly with ILP32 ABI, the upper
// bits must be zero, which is handled here by casting to u64. Another way to
// handle this is to pass it as a pointer and clear the upper bits inside asm,
// but it is easier to overlook than cast, which can catch overlooks by
// asm_sub_register lint.
// See also https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/2025Q1/aapcs64/aapcs64.rst#pointers
//
// Except for x86_64, which can use 32-bit registers in the destination operand
// (on x86_64, we use the ptr_modifier macro to handle this), we need to do the
// same for ILP32 ABI on other 64-bit architectures. (At least, as far as I can
// see from the assembly generated by LLVM, this is also required for MIPS64 N32
// ABI. I don't know about the RISC-V RV64ILP32* ABI, but in any case, this
// should be a safe default for such ABIs).
//
// Known architectures that have such ABI are x86_64 (X32), AArch64 (ILP32),
// mips64 (N32), and riscv64 (RV64ILP32*). (As of 2025-01-23, only the former
// two are supported by rustc.) However, we list all known 64-bit architectures
// because similar ABIs may exist or future added for other architectures.
