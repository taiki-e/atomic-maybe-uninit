## [Unreleased]

- Support pre-v6 ARM Linux/Android (e.g., armv5te-unknown-linux-gnueabi, arm-linux-androideabi, etc.).

## [0.2.19] - 2023-07-27

- Support LoongArch64.

- Fix build error on MIPS32r6 and MIPS64r6 (both tier 3) since [nightly-2023-07-19's target_arch change](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112374).

- Fix build error on big endian ARMv8 AArch32 (tier 3).

- Acknowledge all x86_64 Apple targets support 128-bit atomics.

  Our code already recognizes this via `cfg(target_feature)`, so this only affects users using pre-1.69 stable rustc.

  See also [rust-lang/rust#112150](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112150).

- Optimize inline assemblies.

## [0.2.18] - 2023-05-31

- Fix build error on aarch64 ILP32 ABI targets (tier 3).

- Optimize inline assemblies on PowerPC and s390x.

## [0.2.17] - 2023-05-09

- Fix bug in s390x atomic RMWs on old nightly.

- Optimize inline assemblies on RISC-V, PowerPC, s390x, and MSP430.

## [0.2.16] - 2023-04-30

**Note:** This release has been yanked due to a bug fixed in 0.2.17.

- Support 64-bit atomics on ARMv7-R and ARMv8-R.

- Fix bug in AArch64 16-bit compare_exchange_weak.

- Fix bug in AArch64 128-bit SeqCst load when FEAT_LSE2 is enabled at compile-time.

- Optimize AArch64 atomic load when the `rcpc` target feature is enabled at compile-time.

## [0.2.11] - 2022-07-31

**Note:** This release has been yanked due to a bug fixed in 0.2.16.

- Optimize inline assemblies on x86, ARM, AArch64, and RISC-V.

## [0.2.10] - 2022-07-16

**Note:** This release has been yanked due to a bug fixed in 0.2.16.

- Support ARMv6.

## [0.2.9] - 2022-06-30

**Note:** This release has been yanked due to a bug fixed in 0.2.16.
